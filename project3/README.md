# Final Project: Choose your own adventure
#### CPH 200A Project 3
#### Report Due Date: 5PM PST Dec 7, 2023

## Introduction
Building on the skills you developed in the class, in this project you (in teams of 2 students) will have the opportunity to apply the skills you have learned to a new problem of your choosing. The goal of this project is to give you hands-on experience posing meaningful CPH questions, developing state of the art computational solutions and performing rigorous evaluations to motivate new CPH interventions. Note, these projects do not have to be in cancer but they should draw from the clinical knowledge you picked up in the class. At the end of this project, you will write a project report, motivating your research question, introducing related work, describing your approach, your analyses and discussing their implications.  Submit your **project report** by the due date, **5PM pst on Dec 7th, 2023**. You will give a short talk (12min + 3min QA) about your projects during the last class on **Dec 7th, 2023**.

### Milestones and Timeline

There are a series of intermediate deadlines to keep on track for your final project. These are:

- **Nov 2nd, 2023**: Project proposal due (short abstract (1 page max) describing your plan and datasets)
- **Nov 16th, 2023**: Project progress check ins (Book a meeting with Adam)
- **Dec 7th, 2023**: Final project report due

### Suggested Datasets
While this project truly is **choose your adventure**, you may find of these datasets (in addition to the data from projects 1 and 2) to be useful starting points for your projects.
- [UCSF InfoCommons](https://informationcommons.ucsf.edu/)
  - This contains a large volume ~20k of breast MRIs, all radiology reports, pathology reports, and the EMR.
- [PI-CAI](https://pi-cai.grand-challenge.org/)
- [NCI Genomic Data Commons](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/)
  - Contains large resources across a range of cancer types and modalities (including pathology slides)
- [The Cancer Imaging Archive](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/)
    - Contains large resources across a range of cancer types and modalities including radiology and pathology

### Support
